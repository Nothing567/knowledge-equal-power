    <h2>Parkour Vision<br></h2>
    <h4>=what is & how to get it=</h4>
    <p class="presentation">Let's say that you already started parkour, but you don't find<br>
    spot for that. What if I will say that you already have places to practice and you just don't<br>
    see them? Here I will give you a few things that you can use in parkour and you can find them<br>
    almost anywhere + recomended places where you can practice safely by yourself.

    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>Parkour Vision is the ability to imaginate and to see obstacles almost everywhere.
    Let's take for example a curb. What can you do with a curb? At first maybe you'll say nothing,
    but if you think more you can already see that you can do may many things on a curb.
