    <p>The first step will be always is to identify the fear you want to overcome.
    Then to identify the type of fear and choose the right cope mechanism for it.
    Here are some of them.
    </p>
  <h2><span class="categories">1.When you need to do an action right into the moment, but you fear to say or do it</span></h2>
  <p>When you have situations when you need to say something or do something now and not later, this strategy<br>
is a good cope mechanism with these type of fears. All what you need to do is this:<br>
<br>
 1.To countdown 3 seconds or more, but no more than 5 seconds.<br>
 2.And then to say or make the action you fear.<br>
 <br>

<h3 class="how">BEHIND THE SCENES</h3>
    <p class="how">
      Bassicaly your brain when fears something, more often than not, will try to make you
    to don't do an action by using negative toughts like "She we'll be mad because of you" or "If you do this he will be sad just because of you".<br>
    Or it can use tougths to "say" to you that you can do it later even if you know that later isn't an option, such as "You can pay your bills later" or
    "You don't need to say this now."<br>
       So when you countdown you stop your thoughts who are stoping you to do the action and<br>
    then you just do that, in this way you will not give time to your brain to complain about what are you doing.<br>
